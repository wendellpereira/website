This was a dark period in my life in which I was feeling alone. My family just moved to another state, my father decision after he acquire debts from dangerous people he met me in the street and said “I'm moving tonight, now, and you have to tell your Mother and arrange the move for her and your sister”. And that was how I found myself with twenty years old in that time trying to get in Music college but now without any resources to it because I had to find a place to live.
And I did, I make the move happen not without help from my Mother family.
I didn’t gave up Music college right way, instead I tried to make a living by playing in the bars at night and with that pay for the costs for study at a Music school and prepare to get to Music college. And I got in. Started college studying during the day in Rio and playing at night in Nova Iguaçu (40 Km/ 25 miles from Rio), making this commute by bus, car was far far way dream. But how you would be paid to play at night there was, bad. Not enough to pay rent and food, left alone clothes.
So at this time I had to find a job and forget about Music college for now. Drop college and start job even farther from home, taking two buses and around three hours round commute.
During this period I was only working, arriving at home just to sleep and wake early to get thither hour trip to work every day.
Without a family around, getting the weekends to travel nine hours to see family and get back. To work again.
To be alone in Rio/Nova Iguaçu was like a world of possibilities open for you, at twenties, with a job/money, working in the night, you get to know whoever you want.
But then I find myself downloading Music from internet and got to know Pat Metheny, and in the middle of a bunch of world that this opened for me it was “Letter From Home”.
In a time that I haven’t family around neither a proper place to call home, no one to share things about the day I got letter saying right into my ears that I wasn’t alone. Somehow. 
That was a letter from a home I was missing out, that void of not having a parenthood was in some way filled with a sense that I have a Home. That world the opened for me listening Pat Metheny work was something I could call mine. The Music.
In “Letter From Home” I could hear encouraging phrases, warm words and have a sense of embracing coming at me trying to comfort this lonely person.
That is the power of Music, the power of be able to communicate in levels that reach you in a way you need the most.
That is how Music can save, the day, the party, a period in life, the Life itself.
